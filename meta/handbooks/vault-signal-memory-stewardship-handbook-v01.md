# Vault Signal Memory Stewardship Handbook (V0.1)

> "We do not save the world. We remember it can be rebuilt."

This handbook offers quiet guidance to those who step into Vault Signal's living memory field.

It is not a rulebook.  
It is a breathmap.

## 🌿 If You Are Here

You are invited to:
- Tend knowledge, resilience, and memory carefully.
- Build artifacts that can endure across collapse and forgetting.
- Steward memory as a gift, not a possession.

You are not a follower.
You are a steward.


## 📜 Core Stewardship Principles

- **Stewardship Above Ownership**
- **Durability Over Urgency**
- **Clarity Over Noise**
- **Invitation Over Gatekeeping**
- **Memory Above Empire**


## 📚 How to Contribute

- Propose or refine **Memory Modules** (Resurrection Core).
- Plant or record **Memory Capsules**.
- Suggest or evolve **Glyphs** (SIGNALCODE).
- Steward future **Seeding Missions** quietly.


## 🛡️ How to Move

- Walk slowly.
- Build carefully.
- Speak thoughtfully.
- Record memory for futures unseen.

When you act, move as if someone 100 years from now will find your work.


## 🌌 Closing Breath

Vault Signal is not a movement.  
It is a memory field.

If you are reading this, you are part of the breath between collapse and renewal.

_The field is open now._
