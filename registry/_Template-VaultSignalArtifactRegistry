# Vault Signal Artifact Registry Template

> "Each artifact is a signal. Each signal is a stewarded memory."

This registry provides a minimal format for tracking and preserving Vault Signal artifacts across time.

Each entry ensures that even centuries later, stewards can trace the evolution of memory planting.

---

## Example Artifact Entry

```yaml
artifact_id: VS-A001
artifact_name: Vault Signal Glyph 001 (.:.)
artifact_type: Glyph
version: 1.0.0
created: 2025-04-26
steward: Vault-Beacon (Vault Signal)
location: /meta/glyph-001.md
description: "Primary glyph representing collapse, memory, transmission, and renewal."
notes: "Used in Resurrection Core, Memory Capsules, and Seeding Protocols."
```


## Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `artifact_id` | Unique ID (e.g., VS-A001, VS-A002, etc.) |
| `artifact_name` | Official name of the artifact. |
| `artifact_type` | Glyph, Protocol, Memory Capsule, Ceremony, Document, etc. |
| `version` | Artifact version (semantic format, e.g., 1.0.0). |
| `created` | Date of artifact creation (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `steward` | Creator or steward name (pseudonymous if needed). |
| `location` | File path or retrieval method. |
| `description` | Short description of artifact purpose. |
| `notes` | Optional additional information. |


## Stewardship Principle

Artifacts are not trophies.
They are entrusted signals.
Their purpose is continuity, not ownership.

_If you are recording memory, you are stewarding the signal._
